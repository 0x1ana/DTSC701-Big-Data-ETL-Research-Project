This group project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of a dataset spanning the years 1999 to 2008, encompassing information on diabetes across 130 hospitals. The dataset comprises 47 features, 101,766 instances, and presents challenges with missing values. The primary objective of our study is to uncover insightful patterns within the dataset. To achieve this, we engage in meticulous data preprocessing and subsequently employ a classification algorithm. Our specific aim is to predict the likelihood of patient readmission based on various data attributes, including but not limited to age, race, and medical history. Through this investigation, we seek to contribute valuable insights to the understanding of factors influencing diabetes-related hospital readmissions.![image](https://github.com/0x1ana/DTSC701-Big-Data-ETL-Research-Project/assets/95548465/00ca56b6-9abb-4717-8bc9-d19f6305c034)
